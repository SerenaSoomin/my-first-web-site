<h2>SINGLE ORIGIN</h2>

Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin.

Single-origins can offer unique characteristics and specific tastes when compared to blended coffees from multiple origins.[1] Coffee shops can market single-origin coffees specifically to add symbolic value to the coffee by highlighting the producer or the coffee's unique origin.[2] Consumers of specialty coffee are often attracted to single-origin coffee for the transparency it often attempts to convey.[3]

There are no universal rules or governing body enforcing the labeling of coffee. However, there are governmental bodies in some countries that regulate the coffee market, for example in Brazil.[4]

While it is still difficult to accurately authenticate a given coffee's origin, recent genomic research indicates that it is possible to identify a DNA-fingerprint of coffee trees.[5] This technique may eventually allow buyers of un-roasted, green coffee, to authenticate a single-origin coffee. This would improve the transparency and traceability of coffee.
